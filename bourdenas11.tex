\subsubsection*{Self-adaptive Routing in Multi-hop Sensor Networks}

Another work towards self-adaptive WSN is done by Bourdenas et
al.~\cite{bourdenas11} on application-level, but mainly focused on such
architecture properties as performance and routing. The autonomic routing
service adapts sensor readings routes to avoid low link-quality or overloaded
paths. The adaptation is achieved by forecasting repetitive patterns in quality
of service, using time-series analysis. As a result, they propose a middle-ware,
which provides an adaptable routing policy.

The performance metrics imply a reliability, link quality and traffic volume.
The former is calculated by neighbor beaconing - the node is considered unavailable,
when it does not respond on a beacon. Link quality based on a packet drop rate,
while the traffic volume is calculated by counting passing packets.
