\subsection{COPAL-ML: A Macro Language for Rapid Development of Context-Aware
Applications in Wireless Sensor Networks}

Sehic et. al~\cite{sehic11} propose a Java based API for developing self-adaptive
applications for WSNs. By using this framework developer can specify the way the
contextual data will be collected, processed and used by the application.
COPAL-ML implies such components as:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Context type} specifies the format of the data provided by a WSN.
\item \emph{Publisher} periodically publishes an information about a specific
context type.
\item \emph{Listener} handles an event fired by the publisher and receives a
context type as an argument.
\item \emph{Processor} handles the received data.
\end{itemize}

Along with possible scenario, authors also proposed several processing patterns,
which can be used as solutions for effective self-adaptive application. Despite it
is very promising way towards abstraction of WSN on the high level, the
framework is Java-based, thus, it is applicable for very limited range of sensor
nodes. It is possible, however, to run the framework on the machine with an
unlimited energy source, but in this case the communication between the
framework and the node remains unclear.
