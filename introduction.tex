Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a set of tiny distributed devices, that have 
to collaborate to perform tasks specified by a user. In this context, WSNs are
intimately tied to and inherently dependent on an environment they operate in.
It leads to a necessity to adapt to a unpredicted environmental dynamics.
Adaptation at run-time provides more flexibility in such software behavior as
energy management, protocol and architecture reconfiguration and error handling.
