\subsection*{pTunes: Runtime Parameter Adaptation for Low-power MAC Protocols}

The work of Zimmerling et al.~\cite{zimmerling12} is focused on an adaptation of system level -- MAC
protocol. The proposed framework -- pTunes -- allows to adjust the parameters
of protocols to adapt to link, topology, and traffic dynamics. To this end, authors
analyze the vital parameters -- both protocol dependent and protocol independent
-- of the network, such as: reliability, latency and life-time. The framework also
meets such requirements as: minimum disruption, timeliness, consistency and
energy efficiency.

Evaluation section of the work shows that the framework enhance the network
lifetime, effectively controls the traffic and keeps the QoS even when link
quality is very low. The approach, however, is centralized, thus it is
impossible to perform per-node adjustment. It is also unclear, how much
protocols are supported by the framework.
