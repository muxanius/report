From an application perspective the challenges introduced by WSN are basically
related to their distributed architecture, the scarceness of resources of the single
sensor node, and the reliability issues due to sensor nodes disappearing for
unpredictable faults, communication noises or battery discharging.
\\
This requires the development of ad-hoc programming models that could fit in the
architectural view of the WSN, and that allow the application to react and adapt
to environmental changes.
This section introduces some approaches addressing this kind of problem.
