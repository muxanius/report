The system level requires a lot of coordination between distinct sensors in the
network. Particularly, several works leverage the WSN capabilities in order to
reduce power consumption, make the MAC layer more flexible, and perform routing
in a very efficient way. We take into consideration some of them in order to
cover the main categories of system level improvements in the WSN.
